# 2022-BSPWM-Config

Welcome to my yearly window manager update. I'll admit, I've stopped using window managers on a long period of time. This and that happens, but I do miss using a window manager, so it's time to revisit BSPWM!

## Prerequisites

We will install the following:

- BSPWM and SXHKD
- feh
- picom (ibhagwan fork)[https://github.com/ibhagwan/picom]
